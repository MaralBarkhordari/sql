**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

Reflecting on my past experience as a data analyst, I’ve come to realize that while my primary focus was on interpreting data to guide business decisions, I didn’t always adequately address the ethical aspects of my work. One significant area that stands out is data privacy. Although security measures were in place when I handled sensitive customer information, I now understand the importance of advocating for greater transparency regarding how this data is collected, processed, and utilized. It’s essential to ensure that users are fully informed and give explicit consent before their data is used, and I would prioritize strengthening protections around sensitive information. Incidents of unauthorized access or accidental leaks of sensitive data, such as medical records, serve as stark reminders of the critical need for robust privacy and security measures.

In terms of inequity, I recognize that I previously overlooked the potential for bias within the data I worked with. Bias can be introduced at various points in the data lifecycle, whether during data collection, cleaning, or analysis. Moving forward, I would adopt a more critical perspective on how demographic information is represented, ensuring that diverse groups are adequately included and accurately reflected in my analyses. This proactive approach would not only help mitigate the reinforcement of harmful stereotypes but also prevent the marginalization of underrepresented communities. Understanding the systemic biases that can arise in database design and automation is essential for fostering inclusivity and fairness in data practices.

Lastly, the ethical considerations regarding labor, particularly the often-unseen work of data entry, resonate with me on a deeper level. I plan to acknowledge the human elements behind the data, recognizing that the accuracy and quality of the data we work with are influenced by the individuals involved in its entry and maintenance. Being mindful of the potential biases or errors that can stem from this labor is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the data. I am committed to fostering an environment where the contributions of all individuals are recognized and valued, ensuring that our data practices are not only effective but also ethical and equitable.
